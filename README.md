# Circom by Examples

Deep dive into Circom circuits.

We make heavy use of [Circomlib](./node_modules/circomlib/circuits).

## Setup

Install packages with:

```sh
yarn
```

### Book

We use `mdbook` to create the book, see the [book](./book/) folder. Serve the book locally with:

```sh
yarn book
yarn book:build # without serving
```

## Testing

Run circuit tests with:

```sh
yarn test
```
