# Circom: Circuit Compiler

A "Circuit" is literally what you think, a literal circuit:

- Electronic circuits operate on electricity and electronic gates.
- Digital circuits operate on 0s and 1s and logic gates.
- Arithmetic circuits operate on integers and arithmetic gates.

By integers, we specifically mean "elements of a finite field". This requires a special section on its own, so let's quickly go over it to know what exactly our circuits operate on.
