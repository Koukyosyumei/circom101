# Introduction

Zero-knowledge proofs are a fascinating area of cryptography that allows parties to prove a statement without revealing any extra information about it; just proving that statement alone. In other words, zero-knowledge proofs can demonstrate that something is true, without revealing what makes that "something" true.

You could prove that you know the solution to some equation, without revealing the solution itself. You could prove that you know the preimage of some hash, that is the input to the hash function which resulted in the hash, without revealing what it is!
